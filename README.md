## What Are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are customizable workflows and tools that extend Claude's capabilities. They allow you to:

- **Automate repetitive tasks** - Create reusable workflows for common development patterns
- **Integrate with external tools** - Connect Claude with APIs, databases, and services
- **Enhance productivity** - Leverage specialized expertise across different domains
- **Customize behavior** - Adapt Claude's responses for specific use cases and requirements

Skills can be used across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and the Claude API to provide domain-specific assistance and automation.
## Getting Started

### Installation

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Chat2AnyLLM/code-assistant-manager.git)

To get started with Claude Code skills, install the Code Assistant Manager (CAM):

```bash
# Install CAM
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chat2AnyLLM/code-assistant-manager/main/install.sh | bash

# List available skills
cam skill list

# Install a specific skill (example)
cam skill install zechenzhangAGI/AI-research-SKILLs:19-emerging-techniques/model-merging -a codebuddy,claude
```

### Using Skills in Claude Code

Once installed, skills are automatically available in your Claude Code environment. You can:

- Use skills through natural language commands
- Access specialized tools and workflows
- Integrate with your development workflow

### Using Skills with Claude API

Skills can also be used programmatically via the Claude API for automation and integration purposes.## Contents

## Creating Skills

Want to contribute your own skills? Here's how to get started:

### Skill Development

1. **Choose a domain** - Identify a specific area where you have expertise
2. **Define the workflow** - Map out the steps and logic for your skill
3. **Implement the skill** - Use Claude Code's skill development framework
4. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure your skill works reliably across different scenarios
5. **Document clearly** - Provide comprehensive documentation and examples

### Best Practices

- **Keep it focused** - Each skill should solve one specific problem well
- **Handle errors gracefully** - Include proper error handling and validation
- **Provide examples** - Include usage examples and edge cases
- **Follow conventions** - Use standard patterns and naming conventions
